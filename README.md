# Fibonacci result factored

The present program was written in C and calculates the result of a given N of the fibonacci series (N it's setted initially at 47) factored in product of primes numbers.
The program doesn't work properly after setting an N greater than 47, because the lenght of the number is bigger than the type used, therefore gives bad/ negative results.
